# VBA of Wallstreet

## Overview of Project
Steve is looking to analyze the stock market over the last couple of years for his parents.
  
### Purpose
The purpose of my analysis was to visually show which stocks would be the best option for Steve's parents by comparing the stocks for the last couple of years.  Having all the data in a spreadsheet allows Steve to quickly compare which stocks would be the best option for Steve's parents.
  
## Results
  Louise asked for specific information in which I conducted my analysis on. Louise asked for “Theater Outcomes vs Launch Dates” and “Outcomes vs Goals”. I was able to create two different worksheets using the Kickstarter data to provide Louise a breakdown of the specific information she was looking for.
 
### Analysis of 2017 Stocks
- For the “Theater Outcomes vs Launch Dates”, I created a pivot chart for all the Kickstarter and then filtered by the category theater, the outcomes, the launch date, and the years. I was able to use a line graph to visually show the rates of successful, failed, and canceled shows by month. I determined that the summer months have the most successful events while the winter months had lower shows (successful, failed, canceled) overall.

### Analysis of 2018 Stocks
- For the “Outcomes Based on Goals, I created a chart to show how many “plays” there was that was successful, failed, and/or canceled based on their goals by $5,000 increments. Using those numbers, I was able to determine a percentage for successful, failed, and canceled plays. I took those numbers and put them into a line chart for visual effects. Based on the chart and graph, I determined that the more money a goal is, it is more unlikely that you will be successful in reaching that goal.

## Summary
- What are the advantages of refactoring code?
1. Quicker result feed back time.
2. Can analyze a larger database. 
3. Not reinventing the wheel, using previous code for larger datasets 

- What are the disadvantages of refactoring code?
1. Understanding which code needs to be refactored.
2. Ensuring all code is complete and in the right section.

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
1. I was able to analyze multiple years of stocks is a faster manner. The multiple years contained more datasets which the refactored code allowed me to analyze quickly. 
2. I initially had a single line of code in the wrong section, which led to a run time error and alot of debugging until I figured out the answer.
3. There was new code that I didn't completely understand, I had to research code to ensure I was using it correctly, which took time.
